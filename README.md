# AManchuGrammar

This repository contains a test project to completely retype _A Manchu Grammar, with Analysed Texts_ by P. G. Von MoÌˆllendorff, published in 1892. The book is now in the public domain, and a scan of the book is viewable here: https://archive.org/details/cu31924023341112/

The first part of the project involves typing out all of the Latin-alphabet sections of the book into plain text files. This produces copyable text while also stripping out the formatting. There is a separate text file for each page of the book, labelled p1.txt, p2.txt, p3.txt, et c.
